# Web-Calculator
 The following documentation is focussed on the  web calculator. This process began with writing the software to read  the keyboard for input, and display pressed keys on the screen. Next we  wrote the code which would allow users to enter and edit numbers. Finally we wrote the code  which we allow users to perform calculation. The contents of this document include a user guide, social impliments, hardware software architectures, details of the software, our lessons learned and criticisms of the course. The calculator we have designed or programmed for user friendly manner. The operators come after the operands. No parantheses are used, simply number keys, operators  and the input keys. We used some buttons and html codes for designed the calculator.
